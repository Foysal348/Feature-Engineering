**Overview**

Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning models. It is one of the most critical steps in the machine learning pipeline and often has a greater impact than model selection itself.

This repository provides practical implementations, explanations, and examples of common and advanced feature engineering techniques using Python.
